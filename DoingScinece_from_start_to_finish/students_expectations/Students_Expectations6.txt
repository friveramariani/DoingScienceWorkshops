 My expectation of this activity is  to learn more about the steps to follow in developing an investigation in science. I also hope this experience helps me apply the scientific method in my future life as a professional. I'm willing a lot to learn new concepts that will help me in my student life. I'm really excited to begin this project and I feel it will mark my life in a very special way.
