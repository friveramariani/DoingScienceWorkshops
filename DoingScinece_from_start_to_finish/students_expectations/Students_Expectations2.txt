I want to further my knowledge in science through a diversity of experiments, knowing create excellent hypothesis. The search of information in course get a conclusion. I will also like to help other students who do not understand or need help with something. Science, in my opinion, is all around us in and the more you do and observe; the more fascinated you will become finding answers.
