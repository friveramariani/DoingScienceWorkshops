	I expect to deepen my knowledge on how to use the scientific method. I have been taught the principal steps of this process, and now I count on the workshops to teach me specifically what the scientific method is and how can we make the best of it. 
	Knowing which data is to be trusted, how to design an experiment and how to identify which factors can affect my methodology is vital for my high school years. By learning these things, I will have less probability of having a mistake in my investigation. 
	Also, the career I plan to study is intertwined with science, so the workshops will also help me with my future.
