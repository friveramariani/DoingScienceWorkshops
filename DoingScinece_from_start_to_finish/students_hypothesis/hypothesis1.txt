Based in the information that we have about the students, that they study in the same institution and they have similar ages is very common that they develop a very similar way of expressing themselves. But there can be an exception because they all come from different places and  they heard many different ways of expression. Most of the expression that some students used are based on what they learn in their home. That means that maybe not all the students can develop the same expression, because they come from different places and that means that there is not only the influence that we received in the school, there is also involved the influence that we received in our home.
