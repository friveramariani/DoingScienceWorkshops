
## "Doing Science" Workshop Series 

This repository contains files associated with the Workshop series "Doing Science", which is organized by [Dr. Félix E. Rivera-Mariani](http://www.friveram.com). In this workshop series, students learn, practice, and implement the different epicycles of the scientific method. 

In this workshop series, students...

1) *Evaluate differences* between the linear scientific method often taught at schools and the **real** scientific method, which includes many epicycles at different stages. 

2) *Understand and Synthesize* each of the **phases**, and **epicycles**, of the scientific method

3) *Design* workable goals with examples of scientific projects

4) *Analyze* the different processes towards scientific goals

5) *Apply* protocols to collect data that are "easy" and "not so easy" to analyze

6) *Formulate and answer questions* related to the data-collection process and the data itself

7) *Value* the importance of team-work in the scientific process

8) Understand, elaborate, and communicate with a *scientific mindset*

Currently, this workshop series is being offered to a group of talented students at the Thomas Armstrong High School (Ponce, Puerto Rico), which is a school that specializes in Science and Mathematics, with the contribution of **Mrs. Carmen Noble (Physics Teacher)** and **Ms. Pérez-Pérez (Teacher and Librarian)**. The current series of the workshop is titled ["**Doing Science: from Start to Finish**."](https://github.com/friveramariani/DoingScienceWorkshops/tree/master/DoingScinece_from_start_to_finish). These meetings are taking place **via video conference**.
