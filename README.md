
## "Doing Science" Workshop Series 

This repository contains files associated with the Workshop series "Doing Science", which is organized by [Dr. Félix E. Rivera-Mariani](http://www.friveram.com). In this workshop series, students learn, practice, and implement the different epicycles of the scientific method. 

In this workshop series, students...

1) *Evaluate differences* between the linear scientific method often taught at schools and the **real** scientific method, which includes many epicycles at different stages. 

2) *Understand and Synthesize* each of the **phases**, and **epicycles**, of the scientific method

3) *Design* workable goals with examples of scientific projects

4) *Analyze* the different processes towards scientific goals

5) *Apply* protocols to collect data that are "easy" and "not so easy" to analyze

6) *Formulate and answer questions* related to the data-collection process and the data itself

7) *Value* the importance of team-work in the scientific process

8) Understand, elaborate, and communicate with a *scientific mindset*

Currently, this workshop series is being offered to a group of talented students at the Thomas Armstrong High School (Ponce, Puerto Rico), which is a school that specializes in Science and Mathematics, with the contribution of **Mrs. Carmen Noble (Physics Teacher)** and **Ms. Pérez-Pérez (Teacher and Librarian)**. The current series of the workshop is titled "**Doing Science: from Start to Finish**." These meetings are taking place **via video conference**. 

## Weekly summaries
- **Week 1** (Oct 3rd, 2016): Dr. Rivera-Mariani, the students, Physics Teacher, and the Librarian participated of the first meeting. In this meeting, we got to know each other: students presented themselves as well as Dr. Rivera-Mariani, Mrs. Noble, Ms. Pérez, and the school's principal. Students also were assigned their first homework: *to submit their workshop's expectations* [find them here](https://github.com/friveramariani/DoingScienceWorkshops/tree/master/DoingScinece_from_start_to_finish/students_expectations). Through a [text-mining algorithm](https://github.com/friveramariani/DoingScienceWorkshops/blob/master/DoingScinece_from_start_to_finish/Students_Expectations_TextMining.R) developed by Dr. Rivera-Mariani, we'll familiarize with the students' expectations and at the same time help to adapt the workshop's goals. These expectations are also linked to a [homework 2](https://github.com/friveramariani/DoingScienceWorkshops/blob/master/DoingScinece_from_start_to_finish/homework2_hypothesis.md), which was assigned to the students during week 2 (October 24th, 2016). Find week 1 presentation [here](https://github.com/friveramariani/DoingScienceWorkshops/blob/master/DoingScinece_from_start_to_finish/Doing_Science10032016.pdf). 

- **Week 2** (Oct 24th, 2016): The students were presented the learning goals of the workshop (find them above), and differentiated between the linear and simple scientific method and the **real** scientific method used in the scientific community. Students also began to understand and synthesize the first three phases of the scientific method: *the question, the background research, and the hypothesis*. [Homework 2](https://github.com/friveramariani/DoingScienceWorkshops/blob/master/DoingScinece_from_start_to_finish/homework2_hypothesis.md) was assigned (to develop a hypothesis), which will be discussed in week 3.
